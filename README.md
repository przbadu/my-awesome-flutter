# my-awesome-flutter

This repo will contains list of flutter apps that I will build overtime. Some of the ideas to get started with are:

- Calculator
- Movie app
- List View (with different styles)
- Auth app (with rails API as well as Firebase)
- Simple card
- form inputs with validations
- tic tac toe
